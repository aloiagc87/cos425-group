I spent most of my winter break inside working on programming projects. One in particular monitors the power used by my clothes washer and reports to a remote monitor. The monitor is an M5Core device about 2"x2".1" that has WiFi, a display, some buttons and a speaker in addition to 12 RGB LEDs. When the wash is running it displays the power use and green LED's circle around the device. When the wash is complete, it plays an MP3 file and turns red. Mostly it was a bit of work to remind me when the wash is done. And I had fun!

Over winter break I spent most of my time working. I work part time serving and bartending at a local restaurant. Not having any classes to attend gave me the opportunity to work more. Unfortunately I was not able to travel home and spend Christmas with my family. I ended up working on Christmas day and New Years day as well. I know this sounds pretty uneventful but I was able to make some extra money!
